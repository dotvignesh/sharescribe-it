# sharescribe-it

# Project Overview:
Sharescribe it! Is a platform built with a goal to allow users to stop wasting money on subscriptions that are ‘seldom used but are also occasionally needed’, by sharing their subscriptions with users who have similar needs and hence splitting the bills to make their subscription costs more worth it!
The application uses a simple SQL Query match of users having the same values under ‘subscriptions’ to match them together.
The users are then prompted to purchase a shared subscription of users, that are already purchased, at a lower price.
The price paid by shared users goes directly to the original subscriber thus reducing costs for all users involved in our platform.
The subscription services have been broadly grouped into 5 domains – streaming, education, productivity, magazines and music.

# Objectives:
 -Enable users to share common subscriptions that they wish to. 
 -Result in a decreased spending on subscriptions for our users.
 -Provide users with an increased range of choices other than their inner circles.
 -Provide subscription model companies more potential users by directing our users to their sites, when no share-able subscription is available.
