		<p>Does this seem familiar? You wish to watch one movie but then you shell out a lot more on netflix for a monthly subscription. You wish to read one e-book, but you buy a yearly subscription to audible cause they offer you no other choice. You wish to do a small course to learn to cook chinese, but too bad udemy only has a complete course on cooking Asian cuisines for 3000 bucks. We are here with a solution, not to your bad cooking, but to your unnecessary spending! Share common subscriptions, watch/read/consume only what you require, or more specifically, pay only to your needs! Find numerous others like you who are willing to share their subscriptions, choose a mode of payment that goes only to the subscriber, you heard that right, we charge 0% commission, and get going!<br>
		Awe-d already? We're not suprised ;) </p>
